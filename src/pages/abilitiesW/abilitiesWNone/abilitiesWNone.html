    <h2>Here are the bugs that W has alone.</h2>
    <p>1) The next basic attack used after the 2nd cast of W can (not so unfrequently) deal no damage.</p>
    <p>2) Mordekaiser can heal an enemy Braum if he blocks the heal particles.</p>
    <p>3) This spell can cause FPS issues to any player in the game.</p>
    <p>4) This spell will never grant you an assist unless they actually damage the slain enemy.</p>
    <p>5) If Mordekaiser casts his W when he's alone, if a minion then enters the binding range, nothing will happen.</p>
    <p>6) Mordekaiser can stop trying to attack enemies when his W pops at the end of the 4 seconds of the effect.</p>
    <p>7) This spell can be heard by enemies through fog of war.</p>
