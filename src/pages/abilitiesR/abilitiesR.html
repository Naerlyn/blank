  <h2>Here are the bugs with the ultimate.</h2>
  <p>1) Sometimes, you won't get the ghost of an enemy after they die from your ultimate.</p>
  <p>2) If Mordekaiser uses his ultimate on an Elise the moment she changes forms, the R's animation and sound will go off, but the spell will be cancelled.</p>
  <p>3) If Mordekaiser ults an Aatrox with his passive up, the passive will cleanse the ultimate's DoT.</p>
  <p>4) If an ulted target dies by the fountain turret, it will not generate a ghost.</p>
  <p>5) A Zac in passive form doesn't take any damage from Children of the Grave.</p>
  <p>6) Oftentimes, when having a ghost, the ultimate's icon remains normal instead of being highlighted as it should be.</p>
