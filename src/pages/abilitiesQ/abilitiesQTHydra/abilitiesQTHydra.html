    <h2>Here are the bugs that Q and Titanic Hydra cause together.</h2>
    <p>1) Activating Titanic Hydra while your Q is activated will not reset the timer of your basic attack.</p>
    <p>2) If the magic damage from your Q is enough to kill its target alone, then the attack will not apply any on-hit effects, including the Hydra's passive and active effects.</p>
