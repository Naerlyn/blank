  <h2>Here are the bugs that the Q has alone.</h2>
  <p>1) If an enemy flashes one of your Qs, its animation will complete but the ability will not do anything.</p>
  <p>2) When a minion has less current health than the magic damage of this ability, the physical damage won't be applied, nor will the on-hit effects.</p>
  <p>3) Lulu's E used on Mordekaiser will not make Pix attack alongside Morde's Qs.</p>
  <p>4) If Mordekaiser Qs a target that dies at any point during the animation, even at its very beginning, the animation will complete entirely.</p>
  <p>5) If Mordekaiser has a high attack speed, his Q will be on a lower AS than his basic attacks. The higher the AS, the bigger the speed loss.</p>
